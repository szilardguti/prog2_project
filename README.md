## *main project work for prog2 at **UD***
*****
##### *Made in Unity*

### Initial idea
Take up on an adventure, where u can choose the path, that your party of adventurers take.
Adventure, roll the dice and lvl up like in your favorite fantasy books (minus cutting your fingers).
Choose your own role in the party and enjoy it with your friends or play as all of them and don't let
anyone ruin your game!

### First priority:
* basic menu with some options
* one adventurer on one map
* roll a dice
* basic fight and gameplay functions ( **ROLL MOAR** )

### Second priority:
* multiple adventurers and more adventures
* sound and nicer graphics
* loot and drops

### Third priority:
* networking
* infite dungeons or adventures
* actually play the game
